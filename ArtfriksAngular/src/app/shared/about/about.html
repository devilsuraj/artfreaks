<p style="font-size:13px;text-align:justify"> We are a Non-Commission based Online Art Gallery. Our aim is to create a global platform for artists to showcase and sell their works by connecting to art collectors directly. We wish to create a global art community for free flowing creative exchange  between the artists and audience. Through this endeavour we hope to bring together artists from various cultures and countries to truly create a collection without boundaries </p>
